### Task
We have an array of random integers. Array size is N.  
Find occurrence number of specific integer.  
N >= 10_000

### Solutions
Write solutions using next following Java concepts:

1. Sequential solution. (No concurrency)
2. Low-level concurrency. (Thread object)
3. Thread pool
4. Fork/Join pool

### Profiling
Profile each approach and output result on specific element count:

1. 10_000
2. 100_000
3. 1_000_000
4. 10_000_000
5. 100_000_000
